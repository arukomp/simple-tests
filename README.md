# Simple Tests

TDD? Yes, please! Why not just start your project the RIGHT way?

1. Clone this repo
2. Write your tests
3. Include your source files, and then spec files inside your SpecRunner.html
4. Open SpecRunner.html

It's that simple.

You can find an example test in the `spec/example-spec.js`

*Don't forget to include your source and spec files in the SpecRunner.html!*
